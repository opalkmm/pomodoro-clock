# Study Buddy (Pomodoro Clock)

A clean and minimalistic pomodoro clock to avoid distractions while working or studying.
You can adjust the work session and break session. The default time is 25-minute work session, and 5-minute break. 
My intention is to track my work session while keeping myself motivated, and I hope others can make use of it too.

This pomodoro clock is built with:
* Javascript
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap library
